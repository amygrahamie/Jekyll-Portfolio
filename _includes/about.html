                <h2>About Me</h2>

<p>I am Kyle, you probably have figured that out by now. By day I am a PhD student at the University of Ulster. The title of my research is 'Leveraging Web 2.0 technology for Ambient Assisted Living'. To sum up I like to help older people use the Internet through research in UI/UX, Usability and Online Social Networks.</p>

<p>I graduated in 2009 in MA Multidisciplinary Design and in 2007 in BSc (Hons) Interactive Multimedia Design.</p>

<p>My life consists of Family, Friends and Work.</p>

<p>I have Cerebral Palsy. Its not bad, means I get free parking.</p>
